# validator-labs
The [validator](https://github.com/validator-labs/validator) framework aims to provide an open standard for producing (and alerting on) informative, actionable validation results pertaining to infrastructure, networking, kubernetes cluster internals, and more.

The framework supports two primary use-cases:
1. Pre-flight environment validation
2. Continuous configuration drift monitoring

See the [documentation](https://validator-labs.github.io/docs) for more info.
